A silver gun in which I'm facing
You've got this wrong you are mistaken
Inject me with some kind of poison
Body shuts down and I'm left falling
Am I supposed to fight and leave my soul behind
Blank walls surrounding me stuck in between two scenes
And every part of me was left purple and green
One more lost lonely teen left broke down chasing dreams
Now what am I to do
In this state of feeling confused
Plan out my revenge on you
In this afterlife I see you as the killer
Pulling down on the trigger like I mean nothing to you
In this afterlife I will prove that you're ugly
And make your new boyfriend love me 'til there's no one above me
In the afterlife afterlife afterlife
In the after life after life afterlife
In the after life after lifer after life
In the after life after life after life
A hooded man will be waiting
To kill me right where I began
Then I will die for the third time
Then rise up limping like a zombie
Am I supposed to fight
And leave my soul behind
Blank walls surrounding me
Stuck in between two scenes
And every part of me was left purple
And green one more lost lonely teen
Left broke down chasing dreams
Now what am I to do
In this state of feeling confused
Planning out my revenge on you
In this afterlife I see you as the killer
Pulling down on the trigger like I mean nothing to you
In this afterlife I will prove that you're ugly
And make your new boyfriend love me 'til there's no one above me
In the afterlife afterlife afterlife
In the after life after life afterlife
In the after life after lifer after life
In the after life after life after life
In the afterlife afterlife afterlife
In the after life after life afterlife
In the after life after lifer after life
In the after life after life after life
