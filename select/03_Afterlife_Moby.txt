And after life goes fading on
We had all but now it's gone [?]
We'll all survive
We'll all survive

And now it's over everything
I clean but nothing stays so clean
I had it all
I had it all

And after love goes on the scene
It's over then but not for me [?]
Do it all for love
I'm raging on

Oh my time has come
Oh my time has come
