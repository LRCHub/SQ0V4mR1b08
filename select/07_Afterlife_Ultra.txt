Time has come to give my life up to those hands
Those hands that I've been praying to
Step inside your mind and in time you will find
We live, we die, we fade into the afterlife
Welcome to the sand, sea, land
I won't soon feel bad
When will you work it out
Why can't you see for clouds
Sail on times we had
It's something that I've never been more scared of
In my whole life, whole life, whole life
I'm just a man who is dying
Time has come to give my life up to those hands
Those hands that I've been praying to
Step inside your mind and in time you will find
We live, we die, we fade into the afterlife
Welcome to the end of all time
It's like a light
It's like a way I feel now
It's something that I've never been more scared of
In my whole life, whole life, whole life
I'm just a man who is dying
Time has come to give my life up to those hands
Those hands that I've been praying to
Step inside your mind and in time you will find
We live, we die, we fade into the afterlife
The light goes down but it's much harder now
To bring my face up from the ground
To smile again
Time has come to give my life up to those hands
Those hands that I've been praying to
Step inside your mind and in time you will find
We live, we die, we fade into the afterlife
