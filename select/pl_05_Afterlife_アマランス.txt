Facing the glory open before me,
millions of lightyears to roam
For once in my life the journey
is mine and I don't know
which way to go
Breaking the curse
has given me purpose,
charging into the unknown
Choosing to right
the wrongs far behind
and forging a path of my own
But with such power,
think how you could rule
Hold to your promise to watch
over those in despair
Why would you choose to serve
when you could be master of all
Be true to your honour and
fight for a world that is fair
Out of shadow, out of darkness,
welcome to the light
As the day shines boldly
over night
Follow me to finally be
who you are inside
Open wide, embrace the afterlife
Don't waste your chance
to seek revenge at last
I won't waste my freedom,
vengeance will not make me whole
Fight back you fool, make them
pay for transgressions past
Fear not your anger,
use it to rise up
and free your soul
Out of shadow, out of darkness,
welcome to the light
As the day shines boldly
over night
Follow me to finally be
who you are inside
Open wide, embrace the afterlife
